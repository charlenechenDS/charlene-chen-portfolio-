    "###Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "    Video viewability has been a hot topic in ad tech industry. GroupM has developed its own metric to measure viewability called \"GroupM In-view Rate\" - stricter than industry-wide MRC IVR. In Moat reporting, we use the feature \"Human, Audible & Fully On-Screen for Half of Duration (15 sec. cap) Rate\" as GroupM IVR. According to Moat, the video viewability benchmark for 2016 Q1 is 22.1% for all programmatic media buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "    This project is to determine which features (Advertiser vertical, domain/site, creative size, supply vendor, browser, non-human traffic rate, and small player size rate) will lead to higher (>=22.1%) GroupM IVR and what different roles they are playing (high coefficient vs. low coefficient) when it comes to higher GroupM IVR, based on Moat data from January-March 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis\n",
    "    Advertiser vertical, domain/site, creative size, supply vendor, browser, non-human traffic rate, and small player size rate will allow us to predict if a video will have high viewability. (GroupM IVR>=22.1%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "    First of all, I will throw all data to Random Forrest to choose which features to look deeper. Then, use Lasso to calculate out each co-efficient for top 80% features from RF. To predict outcome - if a video will have high viewability (GroupM IVR>=22.1%), I will use Logistic Regression model to predict a binary value. (High viewability == 1, GroupM IVR>=22.1%; Low viewability == 0, GroupM IVR<22.1%)\n",
